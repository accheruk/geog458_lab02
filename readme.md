# Geo-tagged Tweet Collection on the Seahawks for every NFC West Team


# Summary and Analysis

The topic I chose was how fans of teams in the NFC West reacted to the Seattle Seahawks. The parameter I used for the search was the term "Seahawks". I wanted to make this comparison because every team in the NFC West is rivals with each other. I wanted to see how fans of each team reacted to the Seahawks this season. As expected, all of the word clouds emphasize the word Seahawks. The Seahawks fans had mostly positive things to say about the team as the team unexpectedly made a playoff run despite being in a rebuilding season. Many fans were ecstatic about the success of both the Seattle Mariners and the Seahawks. Most fans also praised Pro Bowl quarterback Geno Smith. 
On the contrary, 49ers fans around Santa Clara mentioned their own team more. They emphasized how they beat the Seahawks in the playoffs and praised their rookie quarterback Brock Purdy. Some fans of the 49ers used cuss words in regards to the Seahawks showing their resentment towards the team. Fans of the Los Angeles Rams mentioned the Niners and Seahawks mostly in positive terms while praising both teams quarterbacks. Fans of the Arizona Cardinals mentioned the Seahawks in a positive light too, while mentioning the niners as well. Cardinals fans praised the Seahawks for their many wins. Some reasons I think that the Cardinals and Rams fans showed mostly support towards the Seahawks is because both of those teams were not very good this season. Since they were not in playoff contention, there was no reason to show hate towards the Seahawks. On the other hand, since the 49ers were in playoff contention and played the Seahawks in the playoffs, 49ers fans showed a lot more resentment towards the team. Finally, to no surprise, the loyal Seahawks fans showed support for their team. I think my research could be improved in the future if I excluded data for when the teams were playing the Seahawks as tweets during those times were more resentful due to the fact that fans were rooting for their own team. I think my research can also be improved if I was able to find a way to not include data from tweets that were made by Seahawks fans that happened to be in a division rivals area or stadium at the time because my data was collected based on distance from teams' stadiums. I think I was pleasantly surprised that Cardinals and Rams fans were supportive of the Seahawks. Considering the grueling rivalries that the Seahawks have had with these teams in the past, I did not expect the fans of the Rams and the Cardinals to show support.

# Geo-tagged Tweet Collection on the Seahawks for every NFC West Team


# Summary and Analysis

The topic I chose was how fans of teams in the NFC West reacted to the Seattle Seahawks. The parameter I used for the search was the term "Seahawks". I wanted to make this comparison because every team in the NFC West is rivals with each other. I wanted to see how fans of each team reacted to the Seahawks this season. As expected, all of the word clouds emphasize the word Seahawks. The Seahawks fans had mostly positive things to say about the team as the team unexpectedly made a playoff run despite being in a rebuilding season. Many fans were ecstatic about the success of both the Seattle Mariners and the Seahawks. Most fans also praised Pro Bowl quarterback Geno Smith.
